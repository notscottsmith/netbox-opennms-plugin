"""Requisition membership + node resolution (conflict model).

A Foreign Source is a user-named **Requisition** whose members are a live NetBox
**filter** over Devices/VMs. Each Requisition resolves **independently** — there
is no priority and no ordering. An object matching two or more Requisitions'
filters is a blocking **conflict** (C1): it is rendered into none of them, and
every involved Requisition is frozen (Sync blocked) until the user makes the
filters disjoint or excludes the object. Excluded objects never conflict — they
are monitored nowhere regardless (C3). This module answers:

* which objects each Requisition **matches** and which of those **conflict**
  (the order-free global resolver, ``resolve_all``),
* what each unconflicted member **resolves to** after per-object overrides
  (``resolve_node`` → a ``NodeSpec`` the renderer emits),
* which Requisitions **match** a given Device/VM (``matching_requisitions`` —
  one match = governed, several = conflicted),
* which **Server** a Requisition's members resolve to (``scope.resolve_scope``,
  per member) — a Requisition renders to exactly one Server; members that
  disagree are a blocking ``ServerConflict`` (multi-server support).

It reads the ORM but performs no writes/network. The unknown-key guard is a
**key-set diff** against the filtersets' known keys (NOT ``is_valid()``, which
silently ignores unknown keys); an empty/no-effective-key filter is rejected;
a recognized key with a stale value is a warning, not a silent empty.
``foreign_id_for`` is unchanged (R6): node identity survives renames.
