"""Live OpenNMS Horizon 36 round-trip + PRESET LIVE-VERIFY (Epic 5).

SKIPPED unless ``OPENNMS_LIVE_URL`` (+ ``OPENNMS_LIVE_USERNAME`` /
``OPENNMS_LIVE_PASSWORD``) is set, so ``make verify`` stays green without OpenNMS.
``make integration`` boots a throwaway H36 and runs this.

This is the Epic 5 HARD GATE. The detector/policy preset registry encodes an
OpenNMS-version contract (class names + parameters) that a unit test cannot
check — the ':'-delimiter bug proved that. This test validates the contract
against a real Horizon:

* ``test_detector_preset_detects_icmp`` — provisions a node whose management IP
  is reachable BY OpenNMS (127.0.0.1) with the ICMP detector preset, imports,
  and asserts OpenNMS auto-detects the ICMP service. This proves the IcmpDetector
  preset class actually resolves and runs (not just that the XML is accepted).
* ``test_all_presets_accepted_and_round_trip`` — builds a profile carrying every
  detector and policy preset, POSTs the foreign-source definition, and reads it
  back asserting each preset's class survived. Catches a malformed/garbled class
  string or XSD-invalid parameter shape for the whole registry.
* ``test_malformed_requisition_is_rejected`` — XSD enforcement still holds.
