"""Dry-run diff of a Requisition against the live OpenNMS state (R7).

Before Sync, compare the rendered intent (``membership.resolve`` → nodes, plus the
Requisition's definition) against what OpenNMS currently holds, per node
(add / remove / change) and for the foreign-source definition
(detectors / policies / scan-interval). The differ is **pure** given the two
parsed OpenNMS JSON documents (the fetch is a thin wrapper), so it is unit-testable
without a live server. A never-synced Foreign Source (current = ``None``) reads as
an all-added diff (M5).

The exact OpenNMS JSON shapes are a wire contract confirmed by ``make integration``;
parsing is deliberately tolerant.
