"""Pre-push intent validation (FR-8) — shared by the Sync view and the job.

Epic 5 moves field-level rules (location syntax, service-on-monitored-IP, IP
ownership) onto the model ``clean()`` methods, so this layer validates the
*resolved* Foreign Source: it forwards the membership layer's skip warnings
(no name / no management IP / excluded) and re-checks the resolved location
names as a safety net before a push. Orchestration-layer (it reads the ORM) but
does no writes/network.
