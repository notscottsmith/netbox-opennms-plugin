"""Foreign Source name derivation — the single owner (AD-14).

Every consumer (translation, jobs, views) must call ``foreign_source_for``;
no module may derive the name inline. The name groups monitored objects by
(site, role) so OpenNMS node identity stays stable.

AD-14 specifies a VM's site as ``vm.site or vm.cluster.site``. NetBox 4.x
replaced ``Cluster.site`` with a generic ``scope``, so the cluster fallback
resolves the cluster's scope when that scope is a Site.

The function has no side effects (no writes, no network) and is deterministic,
but reading the target's ``site``/``role``/``cluster.scope`` may lazily load
related objects — callers in the render/sync paths should pass prefetched
(``select_related``) instances to keep it query-free.
