"""Background jobs — render-and-replace a Foreign Source against OpenNMS (AD-4/5/6).

``SyncForeignSourceJob`` turns the resolved membership of one Foreign Source (the
pure ``membership`` + ``translation`` layers) into a real OpenNMS push through
the ``OpenNMSClient`` port (AD-2). It runs in a NetBox ``JobRunner`` so it never
blocks a request (AD-4), re-renders the *complete* requisition for the Foreign
Source from its current members (AD-5), and serializes per Foreign Source via a
Postgres advisory lock so two syncs cannot race (AD-6).

Epic 5: membership is a live NetBox query (site+role), not per-object profiles,
so a moved/added/removed object re-resolves its scope on the next sync. A
non-last departure is reconciled automatically — re-syncing the surviving
members render-and-replaces the Foreign Source without the gone node. The one
gap: when the LAST member leaves a Foreign Source (object deleted, role/site
changed, or its assignment removed), that Foreign Source is no longer governed,
so neither Sync-All nor per-assignment Sync lists it, and its stale OpenNMS nodes
linger until a manual Remove. A periodic drift reconciler closes this window and
is tracked as deferred work (carried from v1).

Outcome maps to the NetBox ``Job`` lifecycle (AD-12): a clean return is
*succeeded-accepted*; a render or port error raises ``JobFailed`` → *failed*. A
bare ``202`` from import is "accepted for import", never "provisioned".

    own live nodes (``scan.scan_discovery``, scoped by its throwaway Foreign
    Source) and upserts them as ``DiscoveredNode`` rows

    uses for a general per-Server scan, reused here rather than duplicated.

    Settle detection: a scan has "gone quiet" once
    ``discovery_settle_idle_minutes`` have passed with no new node appearing.
    The reference point is the newest node ``createTime`` seen so far
    (``latest_node_created``); before any node has appeared, it falls back to
    ``last_triggered`` so a scan that finds nothing eventually settles too,
    rather than polling forever. Once ``settled_at`` is set it is never
    cleared — a re-triggered scan gets a brand new ``DiscoveryScan`` row
    (ADR 0006), not a reset of this one.
